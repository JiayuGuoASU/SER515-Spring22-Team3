## Introduction

We built software to let the users use our autonomous robot to explore an unexplored map.
### Overview of our software:
Platform: Our software is building on ROS2, using RVIZ and Gazebo to simulate the robot.

GUI: We have a GUI interface for users to easily operate the software.

Robot: We have a two-wheel robot and a customized map.

Mapping System: We use the slam-tool-box to render the map.

Control System: Manually & Automatically control.

Design Pattern: We use design patterns to make our software more robust and strong.
